What this PR does / why we need it:

This PR allows the upgrade of the kube-state-metrics to the latest version, as of today v2.12.0. The upgrade was not possible because of the deprecation of the VPA metrics, which are now supposed to be configured as any other custom resource by using a so-called CustomResourceState feature from the kube-state-metrics. This is a mechanism to tell kube-state-metrics via configuration which keys and values from custom resource spec files need to be mapped into which metrics.

We tried to preserve the old metric labels and naming as much as possible. However, there are few changes. The most significant is that the resource (i.e., CPU or memory) is not a label anymore in the new metrics but part of the metric name.
Example for the blackbox-exporter CPU target recommendation

As for the unit tests, it became a bit tricky to assert that the CustomResourceState configuration matches the expectation because it is about 300 lines long and (a) the ginkgo default configuration will cut the output if the diff is too long in case of test failure and, (b) a long diff is almost an impossible task for the naked eye without additional tooling support. It is for this reason that we decided for a rather unorthodox way to help in this regard.

The expected configuration is stored in a proper YAML file and committed to the repository. When a test that requires validating the CustomResourceState configuration runs (e.g., a test that validates that the new config map is part of the managed resource and contains the right data), it calls a helper function expectedCustomResourceStateConfig() to load this file, which is the test expectation. This function, however, also loads the actual configuration generated by the current code, stores it in a file in the temporary directory and matches it against the expectation. If that succeeds, the test will run. If not, the test will be aborted and a help message will be printed by ginkgo with a diff command to compare both files. It is then up to the developer to compare both files and fix the test accordingly (e.g., replace the expectation file with the new one because the old expectation is not correct anymore). Reviewers can find below and example of this test output.

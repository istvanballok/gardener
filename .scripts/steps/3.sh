# The generic web link 'https://github.com/credativ/plutono'
# is not as specific as some of the previous links, but we do not
# have documentation for the Plutono and Vali projects, so it
# is up to the reader to find the matching documentation pages
# by following the links from the Plutono landing page.

# The documentation shall be revised as well after these generated commits.
